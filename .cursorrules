# Project Rules

## Read First
Before any task, read these files if they exist:
- ROADMAP.md - What we're building
- ARCHITECTURE.md - How it's structured
- CONVENTIONS.md - Code style
- PHASE_*_TASKS.md - Current tasks (find highest number)

## Three Scripts
This project uses three shell scripts as the source of truth:

| Script | Purpose | Success |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `./init.sh` | Setup from fresh clone | Exit 0 = ready to develop |
| `./test.sh` | Run all checks | Exit 0 = safe to deploy |
| `./run.sh` | Start dev environment | Shows running services |

## Workflow

### Before Starting
1. Read the documentation files listed above
2. Run `./test.sh` to confirm project is healthy

### During Development
1. Make small, incremental changes
2. After each change: `./test.sh --quick`
3. Fix failures before continuing
4. Never leave tests broken

### After Completing Work
1. Run full `./test.sh`
2. Update checkboxes in PHASE_*_TASKS.md
3. Ensure project is deployable

## Rules

### Do
- Keep the project deployable at all times
- Follow patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Follow style in CONVENTIONS.md
- Test after every significant change
- Update docs when you change behavior

### Don't
- Skip reading documentation
- Make large changes without testing between
- Leave `./test.sh` failing
- Add code that contradicts existing patterns
- Assume context from previous sessions

## When Stuck
1. Re-read ARCHITECTURE.md for the relevant pattern
2. Check CONVENTIONS.md for style guidance
3. Look at existing code for examples
4. Ask for clarification rather than guessing
